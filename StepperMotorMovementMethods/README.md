This is unfinished... never properly got started with it, went back to getting the main thing working first

This would still be useful to do, to illustrate how the different run methods work.

Do note that we can only use `.run()` and `.runSpeedToPosition()` as those are the only methods that work with the MultiStepper library which allows us to use both steppers at the same time! Otherwise the steppers would run in a step wise motion when making a diagonal move.
