This file will check for incoming messages from the server, parse actions, then vibrate if necessary. 

For now, just press "A" on the Processing app to send a pass vibration... parse it by "Pa". It'll temporarily change from 0 to 1. 



### Plan 

- Just call the vibration function at the end of the MessageHandler function.
